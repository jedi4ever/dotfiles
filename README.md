# Vi
## Installing with ruby and python support
- The standard Macosx vi, does NOT have support for ruby and python.
- Simplest way to install is via homebrew
- Homebrew does not include vim by default
- You can use a formula from [Homebrew-Alt](https://github.com/adamv/homebrew-alt/blob/master/duplicates/vim.rb)

  $ brew install mercurial
  $ brew install https://raw.github.com/adamv/homebrew-alt/master/duplicates/vim.rb
