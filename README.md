# Vi
## Installing with ruby and python support
Tip found via <http://iamnearlythere.com/installing-vim-python-ruby-support-homebrew>

- The standard Macosx vi, does NOT have support for ruby and python.
- Simplest way to install is via homebrew
- Homebrew does not include vim by default
- You can use a formula from [Homebrew-Alt](https://github.com/adamv/homebrew-alt/blob/master/duplicates/vim.rb)

        $ brew install mercurial
        $ brew install https://raw.github.com/adamv/homebrew-alt/master/duplicates/vim.rb

## 256 color terminal support
Tip found via <http://kevin.colyar.net/2011/01/pretty-vim-color-schemes-in-iterm2/>

- The standard Macosx Terminal does not support 256 color schemes
- You can make this work by installing [Iterm2](http://www.iterm2.com/#/section/home)
- This also has awesome support like:
-- Alt-Enter :full screen
-- Alt-(Arrows) : navigate tabs
-- Alt-Command-E : expose
- Change in preferences (xterm to xterm-256)
- Install dessert color scheme: <https://github.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes>
